<!-- 1. What is HTML? -->

<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
we can display web page contant like paragraph, lists, images, and links, in structured way using HTML. -->


<!-- 2. What are the new features in HTML5? -->

<!-- * Semantic Elements : <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>
    * Form Elements: date, email, url, tel, and number, month, week, search, file, range, <textarea>, <keygen>, <output>

<!-- 3. Differentiate between HTML and HTML5  -->

<!-- HTML :- 
1. It didn’t support audio and video without the use of flash player support.
2. It uses cookies to store temporary data.	
3. Does not allow JavaScript to run in browser.
4. It does not allow drag and drop effects.		
5. Character encoding is long and complicated.	
6. It works with all old browsers.	 -->

<!-- HTML5 :- 
1. It supports audio and video controls with the use of <audio> and <video> tags.
2. It uses SQL databases and application cache to store offline data.
3. Allows JavaScript to run in background. This is possible due to JS Web worker API in HTML5.
4. It allows drag and drop effects.
5. Character encoding is simple and easy.
6. It supported by all new browser like Firefox, Mozilla, Chrome, Safari, etc. -->


<!-- 4. What are the basic building blocks of HTML? -->

<!-- Tags:
An HTML tag surrounds the content and applies meaning to it. It is written between < and > brackets. -->

<!-- Attribute:
An attribute in HTML allows extra information about the element, and it is applied within the start tag. An HTML attribute contains two fields: name and value. -->


<!-- 5. What is the purpose of DOCTYPE in HTML?  -->

<!-- Purpose: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML used in a web page. It is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. -->


<!-- 6. What are the different types of lists in HTML?  -->

<!-- unordered lists 
     ordered lists 
     definition lists -->


<!-- 7. Explain the difference between <div> and <span> tags.  -->

<!-- <div> block-level element</div>
<div> creates a new line before and after the element, affecting the layout</div>
<div> It accepts align attribute. </div>

<span> inline element.</span>
<span> does not create new line breaks..</span>
<span> It does not accept align attribute.</span> -->


<!-- 8. Describe the use of semantic HTML.  -->

<!-- A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. -->
<!-- 1. Improved Accessibility:
    2. Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
    3. Enhanced Readability and Maintainability:
    4. Clear Document Structure:
    5. Adaptability and Future-Proofing: -->

<!-- <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <mark>, <nav>, <section>, <summary>, <time> -->


<!-- 9. What are empty elements in HTML?  -->

<!-- * An empty element is a component that doesn’t have any embedded elements or text elements.

<!-- 13. How do you embed audio and video in HTML? -->

<!-- <audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio> -->

    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> -->


<!-- 14. Describe the purpose of the alt attribute in the <img> tag. -->

<!-- 15. Explain the differences between <iframe>, <object>, and <embed> tags. -->

<!-- Flexibility: <iframe> is the most flexible, allowing you to embed entire web pages. 
                 <object> is versatile, supporting various types of media, while 
                 <embed> is specific for embedding multimedia and interactive elements.

    Fallback Content: <iframe> doesn’t provide a built-in way to specify fallback content. 
                      <object> allows fallback contbetween its opening and closing tags. 
                      <embed> does not have built-in fallback content and should be used with alternatmethods for providing fallback content if needed.

    Security: <iframe> is the most secure for embedding content from different origins due to its sandboxing capabilities. 
              <object> and <embed> can potentially pose security risks, especially when embedding interactive or plugin-based content. -->



<!-- 16. What are the different types of heading tags in HTML? -->

<!-- <h1> to <h6>   -->

<!-- 30. What are the differences between HTML elements and HTML tags? -->

<!-- * HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. 
      * HTML element holds the content. -->


<!-- 31. How does HTML5 support geolocation? -->

<!--* HTML5 geolocation detects latitude and longitude coordinates by using the device's GPS (if available on the device) or the device's     mobile/WIFI signal (if GPS is not available.

        * The <i> element, on the other hand, is used to apply stylistic italic formatting to the enclosed text without implying any specific meaning or emphasis. 
        * It is typically used for presentational purposes when the text needs to be italicized for visual aesthetics, but there is no semantic importance attached to the italicized text. -->


<!-- 37. How does HTML support responsive images? -->

<!-- * The most common use of the <picture> element will be for images used in responsive designs. 
     * Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport. -->


<!-- 38. What is the role of the <time> element in HTML5? -->

<!-- * The <time> tag defines a specific time (or datetime).
         * The datetime attribute of this element is used translate the time into a machine-readable format so that browsers can offer to add date reminders through the user's calendar, and search engines can produce smarter search results. -->


<!-- 39. How does HTML support microdata and structured data? -->

<!-- * inline HTML microdata was only used to nest metadata within the HTML content itself and is no longer the preferred method of adding schema to a page. 
     * Now, structured data is implemented into a website's code using JSON-LD as the preferred method. -->


<!-- 40. Explain the differences between <input type="text">, <input type="password">, and <input type="email">. -->

<input type="password">  :-
    * 1. This input type is designed for sensitive data such as passwords.
    * 2. It is specifically meant for sensitive information and is commonly used in login forms.
   
<input type="email">     :-
    * 1. This input type is used for email addresses.
    * 2. Browsers often provide specific keyboard layouts for email input fields on mobile devices to make it easier for users to enter email addresses.

<!-- 44. Explain the role of the async and defer attributes when loading scripts in HTML. -->

<!-- * Use async when the script can be executed independently of other scripts and does not depend on the order of execution or the state of the DOM.
* <script src="script.js" async></script> -->
<!-- * Use defer when the script depends on the order of execution or relies on interactions with the DOM. Deferred scripts provide a way to ensure scripts are executed in order while not blocking the parsing of the HTML document.
* <script src="script.js" defer></script> -->


<!-- 45. Explain the concept of the viewport in HTML and its importance for responsive design. -->

<!-- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
     
* The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. 
* The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. 
* Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size. -->
