<!-- 37. Explain the purpose and usage of the toast component in Bootstrap 5.
ans.-

Purpose:

Non-Intrusive Feedback: Toasts are used to provide non-intrusive feedback to users about the success, failure, or status
of an action. For example, you can display a toast to confirm a successful form submission or to inform the user that an
error occurred during a process.

Informational Alerts: Toasts can be used to present informational alerts or updates, such as news headlines, system
messages, or alerts about new content or features.

Temporary Notifications: They offer a way to display temporary notifications that automatically disappear after a set
period or when the user dismisses them.

User-Friendly Interface: Toasts enhance the user interface by providing a visually appealing and consistent way to
present messages or notifications.

Usage:

To use the toast component in Bootstrap 5, you need to follow these steps:

Include Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript: Make sure you include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML
document.

Structure Your HTML: Create the HTML structure for your toast. This typically involves using a container element with a
specific class, such as <div class="toast">, and including the content you want to display within the toast.

  html

  <div class="toast" role="alert" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true">
    <div class="toast-header">
      Optional: Header content
    </div>
    <div class="toast-body">
      Content to display in the toast
    </div>
  </div> -->

<!-- 38. How does Bootstrap 5 handle responsive display utilities?
  ans.- 1. Responsive Classes:

  Bootstrap 5 offers a set of responsive classes to control the display of elements on various screen sizes. These
  classes allow you to show or hide content based on screen width.

  .d-*: These classes control the overall display property of an element. The asterisk (*) represents different display
  values, such as d-none for hiding an element, d-block for displaying it as a block, or d-inline for displaying it as
  an inline element.

  .d-sm-*, .d-md-*, .d-lg-*, .d-xl-*: These classes apply the display property at different breakpoints, such as small
  (sm), medium (md), large (lg), and extra-large (xl) screens. For example, you can use d-none d-md-block to hide an
  element on small screens but display it as a block on medium screens.

  2. Hiding on Print:

  Bootstrap 5 includes the .d-print-* classes to control the visibility of elements when printing a webpage. These
  classes are useful for creating printer-friendly versions of your web content.

  .d-print-none: Hides an element when printing.

  3. Reordering:

  Bootstrap 5 also includes responsive display classes for reordering elements within a layout. These classes allow you
  to change the order of elements on different screen sizes without modifying the HTML structure.

  .order-*: These classes control the order of elements within a flexbox or grid layout. The asterisk represents
  different values for reordering elements at specific breakpoints. For example, you can use order-1 to move an element
  to the front in the order, and order-md-2 to reorder it on medium-sized screens.

  4. Conditional Classes:

  Bootstrap 5 allows you to use conditional classes to apply responsive display utilities. These classes use a
  combination of display classes and breakpoint classes, enabling more granular control over element visibility. For
  example, you can use d-none d-md-block to hide an element on small screens and display it as a block on medium
  screens.  -->

<!-- 51. Describe how Bootstrap 5 manages responsive display utilities. 
    ans.- 

    Bootstrap 5 provides a set of responsive display utilities that enable you to control the visibility and behavior of elements based on screen size. These utilities are crucial for creating responsive web designs that adapt to various device types and screen sizes. Bootstrap's responsive display utilities make it easy to show or hide elements, change their layout, or modify their behavior on different devices. Here's how Bootstrap 5 manages responsive display utilities:

    Display Classes:
    Bootstrap 5 includes a set of display classes that control the visibility of elements. You can add these classes directly to HTML elements to specify when they should be visible or hidden. The primary classes are:
        d-none: Hides an element on all screen sizes.
        d-sm-none: Hides an element on small screens and larger.
        d-md-none: Hides an element on medium screens (and larger) and smaller.
        d-lg-none: Hides an element on large screens (and larger) and smaller.
        d-xl-none: Hides an element on extra-large screens (and larger) and smaller.
        d-print-none: Hides an element when printing the page.

    You can also use d-*-block classes to display elements only on specific screen sizes.

    Visibility Classes:
    Bootstrap 5 offers visibility classes that let you control the visibility of elements without affecting layout. The main visibility classes are:
        invisible: Makes an element invisible but maintains its layout and spacing.
        invisible-*-up (e.g., invisible-md-up): Makes an element invisible on the specified screen size and larger.
        invisible-*-down (e.g., invisible-xl-down): Makes an element invisible on the specified screen size and smaller.

    Responsive Layout Classes:
    Bootstrap 5 provides responsive layout classes for controlling the display behavior of elements. Some examples include:
        flex-*-column (e.g., flex-md-column): Changes the element's layout to a column on the specified screen size and larger.
        float-*-left (e.g., float-lg-left): Floats the element to the left on the specified screen size and larger.
        text-*-center (e.g., text-sm-center): Centers text alignment on the specified screen size and larger.

    Reordering Elements:
    You can use responsive display classes to reorder elements on different screen sizes. For example, you can use order-* classes to change the order of elements within a flex container.

    html

<div class="d-flex">
  <div class="order-2 order-md-1">Second on mobile, first on medium screens and larger</div>
  <div class="order-1 order-md-2">First on mobile, second on medium screens and larger</div>
</div>

Responsive Text Alignment:

<nav aria-label="Page navigation">
  <ul class="pagination">
    <li class="page-item">
      <a class="page-link" href="#" aria-label="Previous">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>

    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>

        Use the .disabled class to disable "Previous" or "Next" buttons when appropriate.

html

<li class="page-item active">
  <a class="page-link" href="#">1</a>
</li>
<li class="page-item disabled">
